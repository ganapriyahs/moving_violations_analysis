### Moving Violations Analysis – Washington, D.C. (Feb 2025)

This project analyzes geospatial patterns and traffic enforcement insights from the dataset "Moving Violations Issued in February 2025", sourced from data.gov. Using interactive visualizations built with Plotly, the analysis uncovers hotspots, violation trends, fine distribution patterns, and agency-level enforcement activity within Washington, D.C.

#### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
Identify spatial clusters of traffic violations across Washington, D.C.
Explore temporal and categorical trends in violation issuance.
Analyze fine distributions by violation type and enforcement region.
Provide interactive visualizations for deeper exploration of the data.

#### Key Features
Interactive Maps (Mapbox & Density Plots): Identify violation hotspots and fine concentrations.
Trend Analysis: Daily violation counts and category-wise distributions.
Enforcement Insights: Breakdown of tickets by issuing agencies.
Geospatial Visualization: Hotspot detection for high-violation corridors.

#### Tools & Technologies
Python: pandas, numpy, plotly
Plotly: For creating interactive charts and maps
Jupyter Notebook: End-to-end analysis and documentation

#### Insights
Speeding (11–15 MPH over the limit) was the most frequent violation, generating significant fines.
Regional Operations Command–North issued the majority of tickets, indicating centralized enforcement.
Violation hotspots were concentrated in high-traffic corridors, suggesting areas for targeted interventions.
Most fines were under $1,000, with few high-penalty cases.
